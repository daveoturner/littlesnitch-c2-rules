## üéØ Privacy-First Security Philosophy

### Target Threats
- **Telemetry & Tracking**: Complete elimination of data collection
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Sophisticated C2 detection
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized data transmission prevention
- **Malware & Ransomware**: Multi-layered detection and blocking
- **Privacy Violations**: Identity, location, and behavioral tracking

### Security-Privacy Balance
- **Maintains Security Updates**: Critical patches continue to install
- **Preserves Functionality**: Essential services remain operational
- **Zero False Positives**: Carefully crafted rules prevent legitimate breakage
- **User Control**: Granular control over privacy vs. functionality trade-offs

## üöÄ Staged Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Essential Tools (Day 1)
```bash
./install_privacy_stack.sh
```

### Phase 2: Security Updates First (Day 1)
1. Import `security_updates_allow.lsrules` first
2. Test security update functionality
3. Verify critical applications still work

### Phase 3: Progressive Rule Deployment (Week 1-4)
- **Week 1**: System telemetry blocking
- **Week 2**: Application telemetry blocking  
- **Week 3**: Advertising/tracking network blocking
- **Week 4**: Full malware defense rules

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Optimization (Ongoing)
- Review blocked connections daily
- Adjust allow-list exceptions as needed
- Monitor security alerts and logs
- Update rules monthly with new threat intelligence

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Automated Monitoring
- **Real-time Alerts**: Security events trigger macOS notifications
- **Log Analysis**: Automated pattern detection in Little Snitch logs
- **Process Monitoring**: Suspicious process network access detection
- **Configuration Backup**: Automated rule and preference backups

### Weekly Maintenance
